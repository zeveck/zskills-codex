## Codex Adaptation Notes

This is a Codex adaptation of the upstream Z Skills workflow from `github.com/zeveck/zskills` at commit `14dea81da487b2904ea7d69a27295f1869206cdf`. The original text was written for Claude Code slash commands; in Codex, treat command examples such as `/run-plan` as references to the corresponding Codex skill name, for example `run-plan`.

Runtime mappings:
- Claude `Agent` or `Task` dispatch maps to Codex sub-agents only when the current Codex session exposes `spawn_agent`/`wait_agent`. If those tools are unavailable or the task is too tightly coupled, run the workflow inline and clearly state the reduced freshness or isolation.
- Claude cron tools such as `CronCreate`, `CronList`, and `CronDelete` have no guaranteed Codex equivalent. For scheduled modes, explain the requested schedule and either implement it with available local tools after explicit user approval or ask the user to re-run the skill manually.
- Claude `isolation: "worktree"` means create/use a git worktree explicitly with normal git commands when isolation is needed.
- Claude `.claude/*`, hooks, settings, and statusline files are upstream references. Codex does not run Claude hooks or read `.claude/settings.json`. Supporting upstream assets are bundled at `/workspaces/zimulinkCodexZ/.agents/zskills-support` for inspection or manual project adaptation.
- If a workflow references helper commands like `scripts/briefing.cjs`, prefer project-local scripts when present. Otherwise inspect the bundled upstream copy under `/workspaces/zimulinkCodexZ/.agents/zskills-support/scripts` and decide whether to run it from there or copy/adapt it into the current project.
- Keep Codex’s normal safety rules in force: do not revert unrelated work, do not run destructive git commands without an explicit user request, and verify using actual diffs/tests rather than memory.


# plans [rebuild | next | details | work N] — Plan Dashboard & Executor

Maintains `plans/PLAN_INDEX.md` — a structured index of all plan files with
their classification, status, and priority. Also supports batch execution
of ready plans (like `fix-issues` for bugs).

**Modes:**

- **bare** `plans` — display the current index (highlights top-priority ready plan)
- **rebuild** `plans rebuild` — scan all plans, classify, regenerate
- **next** `plans next` — show the highest-priority ready-to-run plan with command
- **details** `plans details` — show every plan with a one-line description
- **work** `plans work N [auto]` — batch-execute next N ready plans
- **stop** `plans stop` — cancel scheduled runs
- **next-run** `plans next-run` — when does the next scheduled run fire?

## Mode: Show (bare `plans`)

1. Read `plans/PLAN_INDEX.md`
2. If the file does not exist, **auto-run rebuild** (Mode: Rebuild below) to
   create it, then display the newly generated index.
3. If the file exists, display a **actionable dashboard** — not a one-line
   summary. Show the actual plan names and status so the user can decide
   what to work on:

   ```
   Plans: 5 ready, 2 in progress, 10 complete

   Ready to Run:
     EDITOR_GAPS_PLAN.md              9 gaps     High
     IMPORT_GAPS_PLAN.md              4 phases   Medium
     INLINE_CHARTS.md                 5 phases   Medium

   In Progress:
     FEATURE_PLAN.md                  Phase 4b   4/8 done
     CORRECTNESS_PLAN.md              Phase 1    1/3 done

   Needs Review: 3 plans (old format, status ambiguous)

   Next: run-plan plans/EDITOR_GAPS_PLAN.md
   ```

   Show Ready and In Progress tables with plan names, phase info, and
   priority. Collapse Complete/Reference into counts. Highlight the
   top-priority ready plan with a suggested `run-plan` command.

4. If the file is older than 24 hours (check mtime), append:
   > ⚠️ Index is older than 24 hours. Run `plans rebuild` to refresh.
5. **Exit.**

## Mode: Details (`plans details`)

Show every plan with a one-line description, grouped by status. Useful
when you have many plans and can't remember what each one is about.

1. Read `plans/PLAN_INDEX.md` (auto-rebuild if missing).
2. For each plan in the index, read its `## Overview` section (first
   paragraph only) and extract a one-line blurb.
3. Display grouped by status (Ready, In Progress, Complete), with the
   blurb after each plan name:

   ```
   Ready to Run:
     DOC_GAPS_PLAN.md (5 phases, Medium)
       Fill documentation gaps: missing READMEs, stale block counts, broken links

     BLOCK_EXPANSION_PLAN.md (4 phases, Medium)
       Add 15 missing blocks via add-block delegate phases

   In Progress:
     CORRECTNESS_PLAN.md (13 phases, 7/13 done)
       Systematic solver accuracy improvements with analytical reference tests

   Complete:
     BRIEFING_SKILL_PLAN.md (7 phases)
       Activity briefing and review dashboard with 5 modes
     ...
   ```

4. **Exit.**

## Mode: Rebuild (`plans rebuild`)

Scan `plans/`, classify every `.md` file, and write a fresh `plans/PLAN_INDEX.md`.

### Step 1 — Inventory

```bash
ls plans/*.md
```

Get all plan files. Ignore subdirectories (e.g., `plans/blocks/`).

Also count block plan files for the coverage summary:
```bash
BLOCK_PLANS=$(find plans/blocks -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
BLOCK_IMPLS=$(grep -c "    type: '" src/library/registry.js 2>/dev/null)
```
Use the registry file for the implementation count — it's the authoritative
registry. `find *Block.js` undercounts because some components (Resistor.js,
Capacitor.js, etc.) don't follow the `*Block.js` naming convention.

### Step 2 — Classify each file

For each file, read the first ~50 lines. Classify into one of three categories:

1. **Executable plan** — has `## Phase` sections (numbered phases with work
   items) OR has a Progress Tracker table (`| Phase | Status |`). These are
   plans that `run-plan` can execute.

   **Meta-plan detection:** If the plan's phases use `### Execution: delegate
   run-plan` directives referencing other plan files, it's a meta-plan. Record
   which sub-plan files it references. In the index, sub-plans should be
   indented under their meta-plan rather than listed independently.

2. **Issue tracker** — filename ends in `_ISSUES.md` OR has an "Issue Tracker"
   or "Issue List" heading OR is primarily a table of GitHub issue numbers.
   List separately — these are not executable by `run-plan`.
   **Deterministic rule:** Files ending in `_ISSUES.md` are ALWAYS classified
   as issue trackers, regardless of other content (e.g., phase sections).
   The filename suffix takes precedence over content-based classification.

3. **Reference document** — everything else (research docs, overviews, gap
   analyses, block library lists). List separately.

### Step 3 — Determine status for executable plans

For each executable plan, determine its status:

1. **Read the Progress Tracker** (if present) — a table with phase rows and
   status indicators:
   - All phases marked `Done` / `Complete` / has a commit hash → **Complete**
   - Some phases done, others pending → **In Progress** (note the current
     phase name and the next incomplete phase)
   - No phases done (all `Not Started` / empty) → **Ready**

2. **No Progress Tracker?** Check for other completion signals:
   - Sections with `**Status:** Done` or `**Status:** Complete` → count as done
   - If all phase sections have completion markers → **Complete**
   - If some do → **In Progress**
   - If the plan has phases but no status indicators at all → **Needs Review**
     (old-format plan; status is ambiguous — may be complete, may not be)
   - Only classify as **Ready** if the plan clearly hasn't been started
     (e.g., freshly created by `draft-plan`)

### Step 4 — Determine priority for "Ready to Run" plans

Rank ready plans by:

1. **Plans referenced by `fix-issues` "too complex" skips** — check
   `SPRINT_REPORT.md` for "Skipped -- Too Complex" entries that reference a
   plan file. Those plans are highest priority (blocking batch fixes).
2. **Recently created plans** — sort by git creation date (newest first).
   Use `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%aI -- <file>` to get each file's
   initial commit date. This avoids conflating "recently written" with
   "recently touched by any edit."
3. **Alphabetical** — tiebreaker.

Assign priority labels: **High** (referenced by fix-issues skips), **Medium**
(recent), **Low** (older/alphabetical fallback).

### Step 5 — Write `plans/PLAN_INDEX.md`

Write the index file with this structure:

```markdown
# Plan Index

Auto-generated by `plans rebuild`. Last rebuilt: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET.

## Ready to Run

| Plan | Phases | Next Phase | Priority | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| [EXAMPLE_PLAN.md](EXAMPLE_PLAN.md) | 5 | 1 -- Setup | High | Referenced by fix-issues skip #NNN |

## In Progress

| Plan | Phases | Current Phase | Next Phase | Notes |
|------|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| [FEATURE_PLAN.md](FEATURE_PLAN.md) | 8 | 4b -- Phase B | 4c -- Phase C | 4 of 8 phases done |

## Needs Review

Old-format plans without progress trackers. Status is ambiguous — may be
complete, partially done, or not started. Triage these once: mark as
Complete, move to Ready, or rewrite with `draft-plan plans/FILE.md`.

| Plan | Phases | Issue | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| [BETTER_SCOPE_PLAN.md](BETTER_SCOPE_PLAN.md) | 3 | No progress tracker | Check if scope overhaul was implemented |

## Complete

| Plan | Phases | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| [RUNTIME_PARITY_META.md](RUNTIME_PARITY_META.md) | 4 | Meta-plan — all sub-plans done |
|   ↳ [RUNTIME_SIGNAL_FLOW_BLOCKS.md](RUNTIME_SIGNAL_FLOW_BLOCKS.md) | 3 | Sub-plan of RUNTIME_PARITY_META |
|   ↳ [RUNTIME_DEPLOY_SERIALIZATION.md](RUNTIME_DEPLOY_SERIALIZATION.md) | 2 | Sub-plan of RUNTIME_PARITY_META |
| [CODEGEN_PLAN.md](CODEGEN_PLAN.md) | 3 | All phases done |

## Reference (not executable)

| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) | Reference | Project overview |
| [ISSUES_PLAN.md](ISSUES_PLAN.md) | Issue Tracker | Master issue index |
| Block Plans (`plans/blocks/`) | Reference | {BLOCK_IMPLS}/{BLOCK_PLANS} implemented |
```

**Notes for each section:**
- If a section would be empty, include the table header with a single row:
  `| (none) | | | | |`
- Use relative links (just the filename, since index is in `plans/`)
- Count phases by counting `## Phase` headings (or progress tracker rows)
- For "In Progress" plans, identify both the current phase (last done) and
  the next phase (first incomplete)
- **Meta-plan grouping:** If a plan is a meta-plan (has `delegate run-plan`
  phases referencing other plan files), indent its sub-plans beneath it
  with `↳` prefix. Sub-plans should NOT appear as separate top-level entries.
  This makes the hierarchy visible — e.g., RUNTIME_PARITY_META owns
  RUNTIME_SIGNAL_FLOW_BLOCKS and RUNTIME_DEPLOY_SERIALIZATION.

## Mode: Next (`plans next`)

1. Read `plans/PLAN_INDEX.md`
2. If the file does not exist, **auto-run rebuild** to create it first.
3. Find the first entry in the "Ready to Run" table (highest priority)
4. If found, output:
   > **Next plan to run:** `EXAMPLE_PLAN.md`
   > Phases: 5, starting at Phase 1 -- Setup
   > Priority: High (referenced by fix-issues skip #NNN)
   >
   > Run with: `run-plan plans/EXAMPLE_PLAN.md`
5. If the "Ready to Run" table is empty or has only `(none)`:
   > No plans ready to run. All executable plans are either in progress or complete.
   > Check "In Progress" plans in the index for plans that need attention.
6. **Exit.**

## Key Rules

- **Rebuild is idempotent** — running it twice produces the same result
  (assuming no plan files changed between runs).
- **Never modify plan files** — the index is read-only metadata. It reads
  plans but never changes them.
- **Skip `plans/blocks/` subdirectories** — those are block-specific plan
  files managed by `add-block`, not executable plans.
- **Skip `PLAN_INDEX.md` itself** — don't index the index.
- **Relative links** — since the index lives in `plans/`, links are just
  filenames (e.g., `[FOO.md](FOO.md)`), not `plans/FOO.md`.
- **Timezone** — always use America/New_York (ET) for the "Last rebuilt"
  timestamp.
